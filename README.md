# One_Size_Fits_All

This repository contains the data and Stata programs (version 16) required to replicate the tables and figures in Michler et al. (2019) as well as the associated appendices. The programs generate all summary tables and figures. In order to construct the final regression tables, some manual editing (and copying/pasting across files) is required, so we do not reproduce them here. However, all relevant numbers are in the regression output generated by the programs files listed below.

The files are as follows:
- `Arouna_et_al_AJAE_replication.do` replicates the all tables and graphics in the paper.
- `Arouna_et_al_AJAE_data.dta` cleaned data used in the analysis.
